Sora has entered the spire! It seems like he got a little confused and started going after the wrong heart in the 
wrong kingdom! Use Sora's Drive Forms to boost you through the spire! Current forms include Valor and Wisdom, 
but Master, Final,and even Anti-Form will all be making their spire debut! Sora also takes advantage of his Combos, 
cards with this keyword will only use their Combo effect when the previous card was a Combo card. What kind of Combo 
chains will you come up with? 

There are currently 35 custom cards along with one custom starter relic for Sora.
More cards and relics are in the works, along with new custom potions and potentially even new special events!

To use this mod you'll need the most recent versions of BaseMod, ModTheSpire, and STSLib. All are available on the
Steam workshop for download.

This mod will also be available on the Steam workshop once more content is added.
