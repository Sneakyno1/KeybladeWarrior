Sora has entered the spire! It seems like he got a little confused and started going after the wrong heart in the 
wrong kingdom! Use Sora's Drive Forms to give you an edge,current forms include Valor, Wisdom, Master, Final, and even Anti Form! Sora also takes advantage of his Combos, 
cards with this keyword will only trigger their Combo effect when the previous card played was a Combo card. What kind of Combo 
chains will you come up with? 

There are over 40 custom cards along with a few custom relics for Sora.
More cards and relics are in the works, along with new custom potions and potentially even new special events!
